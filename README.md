# JAVASCRIPT THE NEW TOYS

## After the basic JS training this project is an upgrade to the latest versions. In theory not a stone should be left unturned after finishing this journey. The map to explore this voyage is based on the teaching of the book: Javascript The New Toys (T.J. Crowder, A Wiley Brand, 2020)
